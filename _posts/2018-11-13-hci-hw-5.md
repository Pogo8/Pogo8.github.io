This is a very rough ui demo using canvas. <br >
When you click on the Window's minimize and close button, an alert appears. <br >
The same applies to the two buttons on the bottom.<br >
I plan to make it more responsive in the future.<br ><br >
But for now, I wanted to showcase that when certain elements of the canvas is selected, I am able to perform some action (in this rought example, a pop-up occurs).
