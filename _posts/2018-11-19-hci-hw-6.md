I have created an interactive canvas that creates a tree. In my version, I have arbitrarily set the maximum number of child nodes to be set to 5. First, by clicking on the "Create Root Node," a root node is created. From there, by clicking on "Create Child Node," up to 5 nodes are created under the root node as a child. By clicking on the "Change Root Node," the program traverses through the ID's of each node. When a specific ID is selected, if a child node is created, it is created underneath the appropriate node. Selecting "Delete Node" deletes the latest created node. I could not draw lines connecting the parent to child, but I may continue this assignment in the near future.<br />
Below is a video demo. <br />
