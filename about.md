Having been born and raised in Jordan and currently living in Korea, I can proudly say that I have experienced the world--on a small scale, ofcourse. My curiosity and interest in all cultures and their history is ever-growing. As a person who has been molded by multicultural experiences, I've become intrigued in the possibilities in bringing cultures and subcultures together. Basically, a people-person interested in YOU.
<br/><br/>
After years of living overseas, I felt like I had not fully understood what it meant to be a Korean. So after my secondary education in Jordan, I decided to come back to Korea for higher education--I wanted to rekindle my Korean roots. I attended Korea University as a Computer Science major. During my time there, I had the opportunity to be a part of the student government where I had the privilege to serve as the vice president and president, consecutively. Along with my military service in the Republic of Korea Army, I had the chance to know what it meant to be a leader; not only that, but further expand my understanding of Korea. I can confidently and proudly say that I am Korean.
<br/><br/>
With my 4 years of academic studies finished, I want to go back out to the world--whatever that may entail. I want to put my past and current experiences to be of good use. 
<br/><br/>
Who knows? I may be able to bring the world closer together.
